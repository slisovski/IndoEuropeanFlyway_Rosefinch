Configuration of the Earth`s land masses exert profound influences on bird migration routes. These influences are a consequence of weather systems, resource availability and ocean, desert or mountain barriers. Bird migration corridors are generally known for major migratory systems, however, knowledge is scarce for the others such as the Indo-European flyway. Here, **we use geolocator tracking data of the Common Rosefinch (Carpodacus erythrinus)** breeding across a large latitudinal gradient - from Finland to Bulgaria -, **and a novel simulation approach to investigate migration pattern and their relation to wind conditions and resources within this flyway**.
